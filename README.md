## Lending Club Dataset Preparation
Data preparation process of Lending Club dataset. It only takes 8 out of all columns available. This task is originated from my own coursework during the Data Mining & Business Intelligence course. The goal is to prepare and transform raw data into a cleaned & ready-to-use version.
